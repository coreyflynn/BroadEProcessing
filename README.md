Code for Corey Flynn's BroadE Processing Demo on 5/10/13

Feel free to modify these files in any way!

What's included:
hive_plot_simple: draw a single hive plot
hive_plot_simple_pdf: draw a single hive plot and render it to pdf instead of the screen
hive_plot_data_table: draw a multiple hive plots based on tabular data input

Note:
the data table example relies on some Classes introduced in Processing 2.0.  If you have an older version of Processing, take this opportunity to upgrade.
